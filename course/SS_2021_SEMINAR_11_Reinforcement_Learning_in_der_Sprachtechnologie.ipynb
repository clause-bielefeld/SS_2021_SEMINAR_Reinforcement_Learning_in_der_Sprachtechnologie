The paper proposes a loss function based on samping and reinforcement learning to generate class-relevant descriptions (explanations).\n",

    "* PROBLEM 1: In decoding, we then face the problem, that there is NO GOLD TOKEN anymore and we have to use the token from the last step as input to the next step. When applying this, our model (most of the time) produces very strange utterances, because HUMANS do not produce sentences based on **what could be the most probable next token**, but more seem to have a look-ahead over the next N tokens (3-8) and then distribute the probability of the main point they want to transmit over these tokens. \n",
    "\n",
    "* PROBLEM 2: there is another problem that can appear: we have a single point of failure in decoding -> that means if we decode one token wrong it will lead our whole output sequence into the wrong direction. During the training, we haven't asked our decoder RNN to use its own output as input, so one single mistake during the generation may confuse the decoder and lead to garbage output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SOLUTION: In practice, what we then apply is BEAM-SEARCH as a trick, to find the most suitable sentence that (hopefully) sounds nice to humans. That means we simulate an N step (most of the time between 5 and 10) look-ahead and out of these sequences we pick the sequence, that after the N steps is the most likely one. \n",

Alternative: BLEU, ROUGE, (CIDER, SPICE, for image descriptions)..... As a gist: overlap metrics, weighted overlap metrics (unigram, bigram, ..), concept-graph metrics (cider, spice).

    "* QUESTION: How to form the DECODING into an RL problem?\n",

    "* FIRST STEP: The first thing to note is that our decoder outputs the **probability distribution at every step**, which is very similar to policy gradient models. From this perspective, our decoder could be seen as an agent trying to decide which token to produce at every step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ADVANTAGES (of framing decoding like this): \n",
    "\n",
    "* 1. GOAL DIRECTED: = convey a certain information. solution = sequence of tokens = sentence => multiple possible solutions/sentences that lead to the goal. (e.g. there are many possible replies to 'how are you?') By optimizing the log-likelihood objective/supervised learning, our model will try to learn some **average of all those replies**, but the average of the phrases might mostly be **'I'm fine, thanks'!** and will not necessarily be a meaningful phrase. By returning the probability distribution and sampling the next token from it, our agent potentially could learn how to produce all possible variants, instead of learning some averaged answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2. SCORE DRIVEN: The second benefit is optimizing the objective that we care about. In log-likelihood training, we're minimizing the cross-entropy between the produced tokens and tokens from the reference, but in machine translation, and many other NLP problems, we don't really care about log-likelihood: we want to maximize the BLEU score of the produced sequence. Unfortunately, the BLEU score is not differentiable, so we can't backpropagate on it. However, policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE (Policy Gradients—an Alternative) work even when the reward is not differentiable: we just push up the probabilities of successful episodes and decrease the worse ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3. SAMPLING: The third advantage we can exploit is in the fact that our sequence generation process is defined by us and we know its internals. By introducing stochasticity into the process of decoding, we can repeat the decoding process several times, gathering different decoding scenarios from the single training sample. This can be beneficial when our training dataset is limited, which is almost always the case. This can be useful in BOOTSTRAPPING our models for generating our own training data. \n",

    "REINFORCE as opposed to e.g. Q-Learning is a **Policy Gradient Method**. The idea behind value-based methods like q-learning was to evaluate every ACTION in every STATE due to it's **goodness to the overall return** and then in every state choose the ACTION with the highest Q-Value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We therefore can say, that in Q-Learning we do not build up a policy, merely we build up a Q-Table/Q-Function and **USE THE Q-TABLE/FUNCTION** in a **GREEDY WAY** (by picking always the action with the highest q-value) to **EXTRACT THE (OPTIMAL) POLICY**. \n",

    "\n",
    "* FUNDAMENTAL: The base for policy gradient methods is the **policy gradient theorem**, which states that this update will converge to the optimal policy. \n",

    "3. come up with another trajectory.\n",

    "In contrast to supervised learning, where we compute the difference of our output to the gold standard over n examples and then average that and move into the direction of the negative gradient to reach the minimum distance, in policy gradient methods, we compute the return over n trajectories and than average that and move into the direction of the gradient to reach the maximum reward. \n",

    "6. We than take the hole SEQUENCE of steps as an EXPERIENCE and apply the policy gradient theorem to our batch of experiences by using the accumulated reward of the whole episode as our SCORING function. This makes it also suitable for sparse reward problems. \n",
    "7. We do this until convergence, and the theorem proves, that over time, the actions that lead to negative rewards are slowly going to be filtered out and for every state, the actions that lead to higher returns at the end of an episode are becoming more likeli. \n",

This leads us to the CREDIT ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM, which is the problem of assigning rewards to specific actions. (=which action caused the reward or what are the (combination) of actions that lead to the reward). In practice this leads to the case that algorithms need a LOT of episodes as EXAMPLES for learning, which means a high training time (sample efficiency). \n",

    "* REWARD SHAPING: Sparse Reward Problems lead to REWARD SHAPING = introducing additional rewards at different time stamps to overcome the sparcity. This leads to different approaches like CURIOSITY or INTRINSIC MOTIVATION, where agents are motivated for e.g. finding new states they never saw before. BUT artificially created reward functions during reward shaping can lead to a lot of problems when done wrong (e.g. an agent that tries to trick the intermediate reward and gets addicted to intermediate rewards and does NOT reach the final reward). That means, that training in sparse reward settings is very hard but at the same time reward shaping is also very tricky crucial for success. \n",

    "* SEQUENCE SELECTION: Better handling of multiple target sequences. For example, 'hi' could be replied with 'hi, hello, not interested', or something else. The RL point of view is to treat our decoder as a process of selecting actions when every action is a token to be generated, which fits better to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "* BLEU-DIRECTED: Optimizing the BLEU score directly instead of cross-entropy loss. Using the BLEU score for the generated sequence as a gradient scale, we can push our model toward the successful sequences and decrease the probability of unsuccessful ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SAMPLING: By repeating the decoding process, we can generate more episodes to train on, which will lead to better gradient estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* SOLUTION: \n",
    "* => Combine the best of both worlds => Use Curriculum Learning (at the beginning teacher forcing, then more and more self-forcing) and then switch to REINFORCE to fine tune the model\n",
    "\n",
    "* PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECT: This is also extremely interesting from a philosophical stand-point and might be the case why TEACHERS and TEACHING might be useful in a group of agents and even through generations of agents. In general, this could be seen as a uniform approach to complex RL problems, when a large action space makes it infeasible to start with a randomly behaving agent, as the chance of such an agent randomly reaching the goal is negligible. => TEACHERS are used to BOOTSTRAP new agents quickly to a certain level until they can REINFORCE themselves to find the best solutions. Sounds like the real world, ha ? \n"
